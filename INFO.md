# INFO — CBH Youth Online — Mobile

> **For AI agents.** Project map for agents working in this repo: how it connects to the sibling repos, features, structure, setup, conventions and recent work. Humans: see `README.md`. Keep this file current - add to **Recent work** and update other sections whenever you change the repo.

Expo / React Native app for **CBH Youth Online (CYO)**, the student forum and social network of THPT Chuyên Biên Hòa (Hà Nam). Store name "CBH Online", bundle/package `com.fatties.youth`.

This README is written so a new contributor — human or AI agent — can pick the repo up cold: what the app does, how it is laid out, how to run it, the conventions to follow, and what changed recently.

## 1. The CBH system (sibling repos)

| Repo (local path) | What it is | Talks to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cbh-youth-online-mobile` (this) | Expo app (iOS/Android) | API over HTTPS + Reverb websockets |
| [cbh-youth-online-api](https://github.com/tunnaduong/cbh-youth-online-api) | Laravel API — `https://api.chuyenbienhoa.com/v1.0/...`, Sanctum bearer tokens, Reverb (chat/realtime) | DB, push, mail |
| [cbh-youth-online-next-js](https://github.com/tunnaduong/cbh-youth-online-next-js) | Next.js web site — `https://chuyenbienhoa.com` (+ `/admin` dashboard) | API |
| [cbh-youth-online-gift-shop](https://github.com/tunnaduong/cbh-youth-online-gift-shop) | Next.js gift shop — `https://giftshop.chuyenbienhoa.com` | API |

How they connect:
- **Auth**: the app stores its Sanctum token in AsyncStorage (`auth_token`) and sends `Authorization: Bearer` (see `app/services/api/axiosInstance.js`). The web sites share one `auth_token` cookie on `.chuyenbienhoa.com`.
- **App → web login**:
  - In-app browser (`openInAppBrowser`, SFSafariViewController / Custom Tabs): a one-time code from `POST /v1.0/web-session/handoff`, opened as `https://<site>/auth/set-token?code=…&return=…`; the site redeems it at `POST /v1.0/web-session/redeem`. Done once per app login (`app/utils/webSession.js` → `withWebSession`).
  - App-owned WebViews: `webViewBootScript` injects the cookie for the current account before each load (plus app mode + theme, below).
- **App mode**: web pages opened by the app get `?app=true` and a `sessionStorage.cbh_app_mode` flag; the sites then hide sign-out, splash, "get the app" banners and off-site links.
- **Deep links**: scheme `com.fatties.youth://` (`post/<id>`, `story/<id>`, `group/<token>`, `oauth`) and universal links on `chuyenbienhoa.com` / `www.chuyenbienhoa.com` (`app.json` `associatedDomains` / intent filters). Routing lives in `App.js` (`navigateToDeepLinkTarget`); in-content CBH links open native screens via `resolveInAppRoute` in `app/utils/externalLink.js`.

---

## 2. Features

- **Onboarding & auth**: welcome carousel, language select (vi/en/ru), first-launch settings, login/signup, forgot password, email verification, Google/Facebook OAuth (PKCE, `app/services/oauth.js`), Apple sign-in, multi-account switcher (`AccountSwitcher`, `utils/savedAccounts.js`).
- **Feed & posts**: infinite home feed, create/edit post (rich text, images, video upload, YouTube/SoundCloud share), votes with voter lists, comments with mentions and slash commands, saved/liked posts, share/forward, OG link preview cards (`LinkPreviewCard`, `utils/linkPreview.js`), link-safety interstitial for external URLs (`LinkSafetyScreen`).
- **Forum**: categories/subforums (`ForumScreen`, `CategoryScreen`), Youth Union news category.
- **Stories**: Instagram-style stories (create with overlays/music, react, reply, viewers sheet, archive).
- **Chat**: 1-1 and group conversations, realtime via Laravel Echo + Reverb (`ChatSocketContext`, `services/echo`), typing, reactions, replies, forwarding, media gallery, chat backgrounds, group info / invites.
- **Notifications**: Expo push (`services/notifications/ExpoNotificationService.js`, `NotificationContext`), unread badges (`UnreadCountsContext`), tap routing (`utils/notificationRouting.js`).
- **Profile**: profile/detail screens, edit profile, Discord-style customization (avatar frames, name fonts/effects, profile effects; `ProfileCustomizerScreen`, `components/profile`, `utils/profileTheme.js`), points milestones, member ranking.
- **Points**: point wallet, deposit/withdraw, gift points (`GiftPointsModal`).
- **Explore**: games (web, in WebView), quizzes + custom quizzes, universities, study materials (view/upload).
- **Reports & feedback**: multi-step student/class violation reports (`ReportScreen/ReportNavigator`), bug report / feedback screen, shake-to-report with screenshot (`ShakeToReport`).
- **Web apps in the app**: sidebar entries **Gift shop** (everyone) and **Admin** (only `userInfo.role === "admin"`), both `WebAppScreen` (see §5).
- **Settings**: theme (light/dark/system, liquid glass toggle, video autoplay), language, security, blocked users, notification settings, student verification, about, terms/privacy, dev console, easter egg (long-press About).
- **Other**: share-intent (`expo-share-intent`), OTA updates (`expo-updates`, channels `preview`/`production`), responsive layout for tablets/foldables (`utils/responsive.js`), in-process "cold restart" (`SessionContext`).

## 4. Setup, run, build

Requirements: Node 18+ / npm, EAS CLI (devDependency `eas-cli`), Android Studio + JDK 17 for Android, Xcode + CocoaPods (macOS) for iOS. Push and OAuth need a real device.

```bash
npm install            # postinstall runs patch-package (patches/)
npm start              # expo start --dev-client  (needs an installed dev-client build)
npm run android        # expo run:android  (build + install dev client locally)
npm run ios            # expo run:ios
```

EAS (`eas.json`, `appVersionSource: local` — bump `app.json` version / buildNumber yourself):
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios|android   # dev client, internal
eas build --profile preview --platform android            # internal APK, channel "preview"
eas build --profile production --platform ios|android     # AAB / IPA, channel "production"
eas submit --profile production
```

Config points:
- API base URL: `app/services/api/axiosInstance.js` (`https://api.chuyenbienhoa.com/`).
- OAuth client ids / redirect: `app/services/oauth.js`.
- Expo project id: `app.json` → `expo.projectId`.
- `package.json` `expo.install.exclude` pins react-native-screens / gesture-handler / keyboard-controller — don't let `expo install --fix` bump them.

There are no automated tests; verify on device. Quick syntax check for a file:
`node -e "require('@babel/core').transformFileSync('<file>',{presets:['babel-preset-expo']})"`.

## 5. Conventions

- **Strings**: every user-facing string goes through i18next (`useTranslation`, `t("section.key")`) with keys added to **all three** of `app/i18n/locales/en.json`, `vi.json`, `ru.json`. When editing those files, insert keys textually — re-serializing the JSON reformats unrelated one-line blocks.
- **Theme**: colors come from `useTheme()` (`theme.primary/text/subText/background/surface/border`, `isDarkMode`, `liquidGlassEnabled`). No hard-coded palette except brand accents already in use.
- **Headers**:
  - Native screens: floating header — `LiquidButton` (pass `scrollY`) + title that fades on scroll, content in an `Animated.ScrollView` with top padding, wrapped in `AndroidGlassBackdrop` (see `PrivacyPolicyScreen`, `FeedbackScreen`, `ReportScreen`).
  - WebView screens (gift shop, admin, games, easter egg): `WebViewHeader` (solid, always visible, plain back button). Don't put floating glass over web content.
- **Status bar**: `useStatusBarStyle(style, bgColor)` on focus.
- **Storage**: auth token + `user_info` in AsyncStorage (`auth_token` is read by the axios interceptor); prefs/caches (theme, avatar versions, handoff flag) in MMKV (`app/global/storage.js`).
- **Navigation**: register new screens in `App.js` (logged-in stack); use `push` for screens that load data once on mount (Post/Profile) so a new target gets a fresh instance.
- **External links**: route through `openExternalLink` / `openInAppBrowser` (`utils/externalLink.js`), never `Linking.openURL` directly for http(s).
- **WebViews of CBH sites**: use `WebAppScreen` (add a `SITES` entry + a `Stack.Screen` with `initialParams={{ site }}`). It injects `webViewBootScript({ token, theme })`, and `lockToSite` keeps a WebView on its domain (blocked navigations show a "back to home" page).
- **Git**: work on branch `dhphuc` (PRs to `main`). Commit messages: conventional commits in English, e.g. `fix(forum): …`, `feat(sidebar): …`. Comments explain *why*, matching the surrounding density.

## 6. Recent work (newest first, as of 2026-10)

- **Two-factor login, logged-in devices, account-switch fixes** (branch `feat/two-factor-auth`, cut from `dhphuc`; written on a machine without Node: **not run yet**). Needs the API branch of the same name.
  - **Login**: `loginRequest` / `loginWithOAuth` send the remembered `device_token`; when the API answers `two_factor_required`, `LoginScreen` and `SignupScreen` navigate to `TwoFactorChallengeScreen` (auth stack), which verifies the code and calls `signIn`.
  - **Security settings**: the old "under development" row now opens `SettingsScreen/TwoFactorScreen.js` (switch, email code or authenticator app, recovery codes, remembered devices). Authenticator setup shows the key and an "open authenticator app" button (`otpauth://` link) instead of a QR code. New `SettingsScreen/DevicesScreen.js` lists logged-in devices with log-out actions.
  - **Device headers**: `app/utils/deviceInfo.js` builds `X-Client-Platform`, `X-Client-Version`, `X-Device-Name`, `X-Device-Model` (URL-encoded), added in the axios request interceptor; it also stores the remembered-device token in AsyncStorage (`two_factor_device_token`). iOS model is only "iPhone"/"iPad" (no `expo-device`).
  - **Account switch** (reported: crash on opening chat and lag after switching; cause not confirmed without a device): `SafeAreaProvider` and `KeyboardProvider` moved outside the keyed `MultiContextProvider` in `App.js`, and the conversation list cache key is now `conversations_<username>` (`ChatScreen/index.js`, `NewConversationScreen.js`). Not addressed yet: `cached_feed` / `cached_notifications` / `cached_forum` are still un-keyed, and the push token stays registered to the previous account.
  - i18n: new `twoFactor.*` and `devices.*` sections in en/vi/ru.

- **WebView close button**: `WebViewHeader` takes `onClose`; gift shop / admin show an X beside the back arrow. Back walks back through the site, X leaves the screen at once.
- **Forum on tablets**: section cards used a 105%-wide background with a fixed 14px correction that only lined up on phones. They're now 100% wide, capped at the feed's max width, and use `useResponsiveLayout` for width (`ForumScreen`).
- **Media gallery**: compact centered tab pill sized to its 3 tabs.
- **Report flow**: Success step now uses the floating header like steps 1-3.
- **WebView screens**: `WebViewHeader` replaces the floating glass button on gift shop / admin / games / easter egg.
- **Gift shop & admin in the app**: new sidebar entries, `WebAppScreen` signs the WebView in as the current account (follows account switches), syncs the app's light/dark theme (`theme` / `giftshop_theme` localStorage keys), and sets app mode. The gift shop is locked to `giftshop.chuyenbienhoa.com`; admin opens other sites in the in-app browser.
- **App → web sign-in** via one-time handoff codes for the in-app browser (main site + gift shop); depends on the API `web-session` endpoints and each site's `/auth/set-token` page.
- **Headers**: floating scroll-aware headers on newer screens; profile effect flicker fix.
- **Profile**: Discord-style profile customization ported from web; points milestones; opaque surfaces when glass is off.
- **Links**: OG preview cards for pasted links; CBH post/profile links open in-app.
- **Chat/posts**: comment input growth, multi-image download.
- **Platform**: iOS 15 launch crash fix (pod deployment targets), large-screen (tablet/foldable) support.
